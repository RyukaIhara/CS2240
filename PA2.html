                        <h2>1960s</h2>
                        <p>The internet as we know it doesn’t exist until much later, but internet history starts in the
                            1960s. In 1962, MIT computer scientist J.C.R. Licklider comes up with the idea for a global
                            computer network. He later shares his idea with colleagues at the U.S. Department of Defense
                            Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). Work by Leonard Kleinrock, Thomas Merrill and
                            Lawrence G. Roberts on packet-switching theory pioneers the way to the world’s first
                            wide-area computer network. Roberts later goes on to publish a plan for the ARPANET, an
                            ARPA-funded computer network that becomes a reality in 1969. Over the following years, the
                            ARPANET grows.</p>

                    <div class="section-content strategy">
                        <h2>1970s</h2>
                        <p>In 1973, Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf collaborate to develop a protocol for linking multiple
                            networks together. This later becomes the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol
                            (TCP/IP), a technology that links multiple networks together such that, if one network is
                            brought down, the others do not collapse. While working at Xerox, Robert Metcalfe develops a
                            system using cables that allows for transfer of more data over a network. He names this
                            system Alto Aloha, but it later becomes known as Ethernet. Over the next few years, Ted
                            Nelson proposes using hypertext to organize network information, and Unix becomes popular
                            for TCP/IP networks. Tom Truscott and Steve Bellovin develop a Unix-based system for
                            transferring data over phone lines via a dial-up connection. This system becomes USENET.</p>

                        <h2>1980s</h2>
                        <p>Dave Farber of the University of Delaware reveals a project to build an inexpensive network
                            using dial-up phone lines. In 1982, the PhoneNet system is established and is connected to
                            ARPANET and the first commercial network, Telenet. This broadens access to the internet and
                            allows for email communication between multiple nations of the world. In 1981, Metcalfe’s
                            company 3Com announces Ethernet products for both computer workstations and personal
                            computers; this allows for the establishment of local area networks (LANs). Paul
                            Mockapetris, Jon Postel and Craig Partridge create the Domain Name system, which uses domain
                            names to manage the increasing number of users on the internet. In 1985, the first domain is
                            registered: symbolics.com, a domain belonging to a computer manufacturer.</p>

                        <h2>1990s</h2>
                        <p>In 1990, ARPANET is decommissioned. Tim Berners-Lee and his colleagues at CERN develop
                            hypertext markup language (HTML) and the uniform resource locator (URL), giving birth to the
                            first incarnation of the World Wide Web. A watershed year for the internet comes in 1995:
                            Microsoft launches Windows 95; Amazon, Yahoo and eBay all launch; Internet Explorer
                            launches; and Java is created, allowing for animation on websites and creating a new flurry
                            of internet activity. In 1996, Congress passes the Communications Decency Act in an effort
                            to combat the growing amount of objectionable material on the internet. John Perry Barlow
                            responds with an essay, A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace. Google is founded
                            in 1998. In 1999, the music and video piracy controversy intensifies with the launch of
                            Napster. The first internet virus capable of copying and sending itself to a user’s address
                            book is discovered in 1999.</p>

                        <p>2000 sees the rise and burst of the dotcom bubble. While myriad internet-based businesses
                            become present in everyday life, the Dow Jones industrial average also sees its biggest
                            one-day drop in history up to that point. By 2001, most publicly traded dotcom companies are
                            gone. It’s not all bad news, though; the 2000s see Google’s meteoric rise to domination of
                            the search engine market. This decade also sees the rise and proliferation of Wi-Fi —
                            wireless internet communication — as well as mobile internet devices like smartphones and,
                            in 2005, the first-ever internet cat video.</p>
